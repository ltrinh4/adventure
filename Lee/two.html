  <h2>Suddenly, “Never Gonna Give You Up” by Rick Astley begins playing on your computer. You chuckle and attempt to close the tab, but to your horror, the video doesn’t close. “Never Gonna let you down,” he sings, as the FBI is notified by your temptations for the Man, the Myth, the Legend.  The video continues, even during your arrest, and you’ll forever be remembered as, “The One Given Up On.”</h2>
